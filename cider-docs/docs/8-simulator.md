# Game Simulator

The **Game Simulator** is a dedicated space for playtesting your game directly inside Cider. It allows you to interact with decks and components as if they were laid out on a physical table.

## Key Features

### Decks (Stacks)
Decks imported from the main app appear as movable card stacks. Use the right-click (context menu) to access these options:

*   **Draw Card (Face Up/Down):** Move the top card from the stack to the table (field).
*   **Draw Specific Card:** Search and draw a single, non-random card from anywhere in the deck.
*   **Shuffle Stack:** Randomly reorder the cards in the stack.
*   **Flip Stack:** Reverse the orientation (face up/face down) of the stack.
*   **Split in Half:** Divide the stack into two new stacks.
*   **Split by Attribute:** Create new stacks based on a selected card attribute (e.g., split a deck into stacks of "Warrior" and "Mage" cards).
*   **Discard:** Cards can be dragged and dropped onto the dedicated **Discard** pile.

### Cards on the Field
Cards moved onto the main play area (`field`) can be freely positioned and inspected.

*   **Move:** Drag cards to any location on the field.
*   **Magnify:** Middle-click (or hold `Alt/Option`) on a card to temporarily zoom in for a detailed view.
*   **Flip:** Right-click a card and select "Flip Card" to toggle its face-up/face-down state.
*   **Create Stack:** Right-click a card on the field to turn it into a new, single-card stack.

### Game Components
Right-click on any empty spot in the field to add common game components:

*   **Coins:** Two-sided tokens that can be flipped randomly.
*   **Cubes:** Simple tokens for tracking resources or damage.
*   **Dice (D6):** Six-sided dice that can be randomly rolled.
