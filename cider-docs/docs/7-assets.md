# Assets

## Image Assets
Import images to use in the card templates.

You can then reference those images in your card template.
Reference any asset (names are in kebab case 
Ex. 'Apple Image' -> 'apple-image').
```
<img src="{{assets.apple-image}}"/>
```

### Procedurally Generated Assets
It can be a hassle to figure out what art you want early in your design. Sometimes you just need something abstract to sit as a placeholder until you figure out your design and theme. This generator produces royalty free symbols, badges, art, banners, and textboxes for your design.

Right click on the assets folder and select `Generate New Asset` to open the
image generator page. There you can generate:
* symbols
* badges
* art
* banners
* textboxes


## Font Assets
Import fonts to use in the card templates.

Configure [Custom Fonts](./design/custom-fonts) globally in the `global-styles.css` file.
