# Card Template

Cider uses a powerful **Template Wizard** to guide you through creating a new card template. The process has three main steps:

1.  **Card Size:** Choose the physical dimensions for your cards.
    *   **Standard Sizes** (e.g., Poker, Bridge, Tarot) are prepopulated with industry-standard dimensions.
    *   **Layouts** are available in both Portrait and Landscape orientations.

| Size Name | Dimensions (px) | Aspect Ratio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Poker | 825 x 1125 | 2.5" x 3.5" |
| Bridge | 750 x 1125 | 2.25" x 3.5" |
| Tarot | 900 x 1500 | 2.75" x 4.75" |
| Square | 1125 x 1125 | 3.5" x 3.5" |

2.  **Layout:** Choose a starter layout based on the game style you are designing. These layouts provide the fundamental HTML and CSS structure.
    *   **Core:** A classic, balanced layout for standard trading card games.
    *   **Mystic / Arcane / Keep / Mire:** Varied thematic layouts with different badge/textbox placements.
    *   **Trick:** A two-sided, mirrored layout perfect for standard playing card games.
    *   **Back:** A simple layout intended for the back of any card, typically symmetric.

3.  **Design:** Select one of the random color themes provided, or use the "Plain" default. You can customize the colors and generated asset images before saving.
